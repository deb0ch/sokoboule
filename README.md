# sokoboule
A little Mario Sokoban based on the tutorial on openclassrooms.com (formerly known as Le Site Du Zero) !

This was my first real program, when I was learning C by myself. I keep it because of nostalgy =)

If you are currently trying out the openclassroom tutorial, I wish you as much fun as I've had when I was doing it !

This website is totally awesome for beginners !
